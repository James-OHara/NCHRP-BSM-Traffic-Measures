# Project Description

This project is the code developed to evaluate the algorithms created for safety and mobility measure estimation using Basic Safety Messages for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Transportation Research Board of The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 03-137: Algorithms to Convert Basic Safety Messages into Traffic Measures research project. A detailed description of the methodologies can be found in the project final report. The source code is divided into two folders Mobility Algorithms developed by Noblis and Safety Algorithms developed by New York University C2SMART University Transportation Center under the lead of Noblis. README files are included in each folder that provide additional details on prerequisites, usage and notes.
